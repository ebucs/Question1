Solution for Question 1

To Run the application you will first need to run "update-database" in the package-manager console.
This should create the database.
Once that's done you can run the application.

NB: There is no need for a backed-up database since once you run the application the Person and Info Data is automatically seeded into the database allowing you to login in and edit the info and password.
